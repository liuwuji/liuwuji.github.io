I am an assistant professor at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), working on computer architecture design, software-hardware co-design, and GPGPU for flexible/efficient deep learning and cloud gaming applications.

Before joining SJTU, I received the PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University of Computer Science and Technology in 2021, where I was supervised by Prof. Xiaoyao Liang.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
